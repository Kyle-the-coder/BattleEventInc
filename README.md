# BattleEventInc
Full Stack Web App. This is my first Python, Flask, and MySQL project where users can register, login, and host a dance battle tournament. Designed to make hosting and running a dance battle event much easier and smoother for everyone involved.

ðŸ‘€ Created a database using MySQL to store user and event information and used SQL queries so users information can be accessed and displayed. Generates a Bcrypt password using Bcrypt when userâ€™s register for user security between developer and user:

:brain: Users can see upcoming events that other users posted and see who has signed up for those events as well as the Google map using Google Maps API:

:open_book: Allows users to sign up for a tournament using One To Many relationship so the host can see the participants. Employed Flask framework for use of Jinja2 for conditional rendering of userâ€™s information and displaying functional information to accelerate the userâ€™s experience:

:pencil2: The Tournament host can use the "Prelim Page" which shows all the participants in the tournament and easily allows them to pick a top 16. (Tournament Bracket Generator is a 2nd version function)

In conclusion this app was designed from my background as a battle dancer. Most events have a hard time keeping track of participants because they still use paper and pencil for sign up sheets. I am looking to design an app that can streamline those tasks, reduce the waste of paper, and create a fun and friendly way for everyone to participate in a tournament. Thank you for taking the time to look at my project!
